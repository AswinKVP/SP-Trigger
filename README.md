# SQL_Server

###### Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network.

### [Stored Procedures](https://github.com/Burakkylmz/SQL_Server/tree/master/Stored_Procedures)

Most of the popular relational database systems, SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL and the like, support stored procedures. A stored procedure is nothing more than a piece of code that performs some repetitive set of actions. It performs a particular task by executing a set of actions or queries against the database. The code for the stored procedure is stored in the database and can be executed at any time. Stored procedures are typically used to insert your records into one of more tables, update or delete data from tables, and to generate reports via the SELECT statement. It's actually possible for a stored procedure to do more than one thing.
